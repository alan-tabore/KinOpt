	abstract = {In this study, a new theoretical model is developed to describe the effect of diffusional limitations on the cure kinetics of epoxy-anhydride resins based on the free volume theory. Different from the previous models, a new diffusion factor is developed by introducing the power law to describe the average distribution of free volume, in which, a fractional exponent related to the power law distribution is established to describe the effect of diffusion. The fractional exponent is verified to be actually temperature dependent by using experimental data. Then, a new diffusioncontrol model is obtained by modifying Kamal’s autocatalytic model with the new diffusion factor. Finally, the isothermal cure data were fitted with the new model very well. The resultant kinetic model can describe the autocatalytic reaction as well as diffusion-limited regimes, and also the temperature-dependent ultimate conversion.},

An explanation of this is given. For long time predictions, the FR method can lead to inaccurate results.},

	abstract = {The thermal effect of a reaction makes the temperature inside the reaction system deviate from a prescribed heating program. To take into account the effect of such temperature deviations on kinetic evaluations, a computational method applicable to an arbitrary variation in temperature has been developed. The method combines the isoconversional principle of evaluating the activation energy with numerical integration of the equation, dα/dt = k[T(t)]f(α), over the actual variation of the temperature with the time, T(t). Details of the numerical algorithm are reported. A model example has been used to verify the reliability of this method as compared to an analogous method which does not account for the deviations of the temperature from a prescribed program. The method has been tested for tolerance for noise in the temperature. © 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

In this study, isoconversional methods are applied to understand the reaction complexity. The activation energy depends on the extent of conversion. It can be shown that three parallel reactions occur during the evolution of the global reaction in non-isothermal conditions. An original multi-step model can involve these three parallel independent reactions. Dynamic viscosity is measured as a function of time and is found independent of shear rate. Isothermal viscosity rise is related to reaction extent by a phenomenological model. The gelation time is determined by the tanδ crossover at different frequencies. Polym. Eng.

	abstract = {The curing reactions of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A with m-phenylene diamine (m-PDA) were studied with a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under isothermal conditions in the range 50–150°C. A computerized data acquisition system was used to collect and process rate and integral heat of reaction data during cure. A mathematical model describing the auto-accelerated reactions up to the diffusion-controlled stage is proposed. The rate constants were determined and used in the model to predict the progress of the cure reaction at different temperatures. Agreement with experimental reaction rate data is within ±5\%. The activation energies for these rate constants are 11–18 kcal mol−1. Overall activation energies determined from theological gel time measurements and predicted gel time from the kinetic model are 11–12 kcal mol−1. The rate of heat generation at the peak of the reaction isotherm curve was correlated with the isothermal cure temperature using an Arrhenius equation. The extent of conversion at the peak was found constant and was used to obtain heat of cure at high temperatures. Values for the overall activation energy calculated from the gel time and the peak reaction rate are 11–12 kcal mol−1. The residual conversion after an isothermal cure at temperature Tc, varied exponentially with the glass transition temperature Tχ. The latter was found to be 10–13°C higher than Tc. The Tχ of the fully cured material is 122–158°C depending on the amount of diamine used. The isothermal cure temperature below which the material passes through vitrification without gelling was determined from DSC cure data. The results presented in this paper are discussed and compared with published data.},
