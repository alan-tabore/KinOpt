Extracting the data
====================

You've probably put a lot of efforts in collecting kinetic data, so let's use them.

Ideally, you'll have collected kinetic data for multiple temperature program.
Store them in the same folder and:

1. Click on the "Add file(s)" button of the data extraction dock
2. Navigate to the folder containing your data
3. Selected all your files
4. Make sure that the file list becomes green (indicating the extraction was successful)
